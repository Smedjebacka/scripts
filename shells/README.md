# Various scripts

Some bash scripts that generally iterate child folders that are git repos, and do stuff in those git repos.

# Instructions

Place the script in a parent folder that contains many git repos.

Cd to the parent folder, and do:
```
./git-grep-all.sh MySearchString
```

Look in each script for more info on arguments.
